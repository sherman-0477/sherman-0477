## Hi there 👋

[![Sherman's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=sherman-0477)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)
I'm Sherman, and I am a computer engineering student at the University of Ottawa.
I have experience in C/C++, Java, Python, VHDL, and Web development.
My repository mainly consists of things I've learned/done during labs. Feel free to take a look
